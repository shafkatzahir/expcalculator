# Exponential Function Calculator



## Description
This project presents the implementation of a scientific calculator function, F7: x^y (Integer Exponentiation), as part of the SOEN 6011 course. The development process adheres to modern software engineering practices, treating styling, versioning, testing, and documenting as primary concerns. The final deliverable is a robust, user-friendly JavaFX application built from scratch, verified with industry-standard static analysis and styling tools, and fully unit-tested. The version is v1.0.0, following Semantic Versioning guidelines.
